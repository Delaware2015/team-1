Benefits of colleges can be reaped from an associate’s degree from a community college. 
In addition, students can start at community colleges or do intense scholarship searches. 
There are families that didn’t have to touch their college savings accounts because they 
coordinated the scholarship search from early on. Parents of high schoolers need to talk 
to their child’s high school counselor about college funding options beginning in freshman 
year. While most scholarship applications aren’t available that early, students ill get an 
idea of what they need to do academically and in the community ot earn scholarship dollars.

why college??
Going to college is not for everyone, but it is an option that every student should consider.
Why? ...because there are so many types of colleges and college level programs available ....
opportunities that will suit nearly every need or interest and the various talents and abilities 
found among individual high school students. A good education is beneficial from many different 
viewpoints, and while the importance of a college education is quite evident for many high school 
students, what is often not as clear is how they will pay for that education.
